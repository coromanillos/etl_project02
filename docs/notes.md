##Virtual Environments 001##
------------------------------
- It is good practice to make sure you use a virtual environment before starting a project.
This guarantees that your environment is isolates and modules/libraries are orderly.

- Locate to directory: *bash:* python -m venv <virtualenvname>
- Activate venv *bash:* .\<virtualenvironmentname>\Scripts\activate
- To deactivate *bash:* deactivate
- List packages *bash:* pip list
- Easy requirements.txt *bash:* pip freeze > requirements.txt
